# `redcap-api` - ARS external-collaboration
A mirror of the ```redcap-api``` code snippets provided by the REDCap Consortium.

Note that several of these appear to be quite out of date.  

*Important*: The ```matlab``` code snippets are no longer provided by the Consortium as examples - UCSF had an old copy of these for a consult in 2017; we have restored them here for review.  Please see the readme file in that directory for more discussion.
